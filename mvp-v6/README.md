# AgentOS MVP-v6

Status: Draft
Date: 2026-01-15

Purpose: Minimal, deterministic kernel that leverages Cursor feature synergies without forcing a single workflow pattern.

Use:
- Copy `mvp-v6/.cursor` into a repo to activate the adapter.
- Start with `/agentos` and supply intent; vocabulary is flexible.
- Decision cards are loaded on demand.
- Use `/probe` to run experimental theories/probes (Draft -> Validated/Falsified).
