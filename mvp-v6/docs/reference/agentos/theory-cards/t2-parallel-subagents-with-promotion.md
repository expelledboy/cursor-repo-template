# Theory Card T2: Parallel subagents (with promotion) improve throughput

Status: Draft
Date: 2026-01-15

## Hypothesis
Parallel subagents accelerate exploration (ideas, candidate files, approaches) without increasing final error rate when their outputs are treated as proposals unless promoted by SIG_U or verified by SIG_T.

## Prediction
Ambiguous tasks reach a coherent plan with fewer iterations.

## Falsifier
If probe runs show increased incorrect changes or more user clarification cycles, mark Falsified.
