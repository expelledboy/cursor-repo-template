# Theory Card T1: Tools > Search (for correctness)

Status: Draft
Date: 2026-01-15

## Hypothesis
When a claim is checkable via tools, using SIG_T (terminal/browser/MCP) yields fewer incorrect conclusions than relying on SIG_S (semantic search) alone.

## Prediction
On tasks with a verifiable ground truth, tool-validated answers will contradict search-only answers non-trivially.

## Falsifier
If >= 3 probe runs show no measurable reduction in incorrect conclusions, mark Falsified.
