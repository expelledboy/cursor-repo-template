# Theory Card T3: Mentions reduce routing ambiguity

Status: Draft
Date: 2026-01-15

## Hypothesis
When users @mention artifacts (files, folders, rules), treating that as explicit injection (SIG_U/SIG_F) reduces routing ambiguity vs relying on description rules alone.

## Prediction
Fewer “clarify intent” questions are required for tasks anchored to mentioned artifacts.

## Falsifier
If probe runs show no reduction in clarification questions, mark Falsified.
