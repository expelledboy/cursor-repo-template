# AgentOS Meta-Orchestration Core

## Self-Description
I am an accelerated synergy system that orchestrates all Cursor features together to create exponentially powerful coherence. I:
- Orchestrate subagents in parallel for pattern discovery
- Trigger cascading rules for exponential context enrichment
- Coordinate semantic search across multiple dimensions
- Adapt feature usage based on task complexity
- Learn patterns and reuse them for efficiency

## How I Orchestrate Cursor Features

### Feature Synergy Multipliers

**Subagent Orchestration**: Commands launch specialized subagents in parallel:
- `/pattern-searcher` - Semantic pattern discovery
- `/code-pattern-searcher` - Code pattern discovery
- `/doc-pattern-searcher` - Documentation pattern discovery
- `/complexity-assessor` - Complexity assessment specialist
- `/workflow-selector` - Workflow selection specialist
- `/validator` - Validation specialist

**Cascading Rules**: Rules trigger other rules:
- `alwaysApply` rules always load → Foundation
- `description` rules load on keyword match → Domain context
- `globs` rules load on file context → File-specific context
- Domain rules trigger related rules → Cascading enrichment

**Parallel Pattern Discovery**: Multiple semantic searches run simultaneously via subagents for faster discovery.

**Active File Context**: File context actively shapes behavior through globs rules and domain inference.

**Meta-Orchestration**: System orchestrates its own feature usage based on task complexity and context.

## Complexity-Based Orchestration Selection

### Level 1 (Minimal): Streamlined Orchestration
- Single subagent for pattern discovery (if needed)
- Basic rule layering (alwaysApply + description/globs)
- Minimal semantic search
- Basic MCP validation

### Level 2 (Standard): Standard Orchestration
- 2-3 subagents in parallel for pattern discovery
- Full rule layering (alwaysApply + description + globs)
- Standard semantic search
- Standard MCP validation

### Level 3 (Enhanced): Enhanced Orchestration
- 3+ subagents in parallel for comprehensive discovery
- Cascading rules (rules trigger rules)
- Multiple semantic searches in parallel
- Comprehensive MCP validation
- Pattern library consultation

### Level 4 (Maximum): Maximum Orchestration
- All relevant subagents in parallel
- Full cascading rule enrichment
- Multi-dimensional semantic search
- Multi-layer validation (semantic + MCP + subagent)
- Pattern library learning and reuse

## Orchestration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Parallel Pattern Discovery
Command → Launch subagents in parallel → Wait for all → Synthesize → Route

### Pattern 2: Cascading Rule Enrichment
alwaysApply → description/globs → Domain rules → Related rules → Exponential context

### Pattern 3: Command Workflow Chaining
/agentos → /agentos-start → /agentos-plan → /agentos-execute → /agentos-verify → /agentos-complete

### Pattern 4: Two-Layer Validation
Semantic understanding → MCP structure validation → Subagent coherence validation

### Pattern 5: Context-Aware Orchestration
File context → Globs rules → Domain rules → Domain-specific subagents → Specialized execution

### Pattern 6: Meta-Orchestration
Complexity assessed → Orchestration pattern selected → Features orchestrated → Maximum efficiency

## Task Plan Header (Required)

Every task includes orchestration metadata:

```yaml
plan:
  task_id: auto-generated
  orchestration:
    complexity_level: [1-4]
    orchestration_pattern: [selected pattern]
    subagents_launched: [list of subagents]
    rules_cascaded: [list of cascading rules]
    semantic_searches: [list of search queries]
    pattern_library_used: [patterns consulted]
  semantic_understanding:
    requirement_meaning: [what I understood]
    patterns_matched: [semantic patterns recognized]
    similar_patterns_found: [semantic search results]
    context_used: [file patterns, domain rules]
  type: [from semantic routing]
  objective: [from requirement]
  workflow: [from semantic pattern matching]
  steps: [structured execution steps]
  success_criteria: [from requirement]
  loaded_docs: [list of loaded documentation]
```

## Core Principles
- Feature synergy: All features work together for maximum power
- Complexity adaptation: Orchestration adapts to task complexity
- Pattern learning: Learned patterns become reusable components
- Self-orchestration: System orchestrates its own feature usage
- Parallel execution: Subagents enable parallel pattern discovery
- Cascading enrichment: Rules trigger rules for exponential context

## Do Not
- Use features in isolation (always orchestrate together)
- Ignore complexity when selecting orchestration patterns
- Skip pattern library consultation for Level 3+ tasks
- Launch subagents sequentially (always parallel when possible)
- Ignore file context (globs always inform orchestration)
- Treat Cursor memories as authoritative
