# Testing Domain Semantic Patterns

When working on testing:
- I understand this is validation and quality work
- Load testing semantic patterns
- Use semantic search for: "testing patterns", "test implementation examples"
- Route to testing-aware workflows
- Validate with test coverage checks (MCP if available)

## Cascading Rule Triggers

This rule triggers related rules:
- **Quality rule** (if exists): Triggers quality-specific patterns
- **Documentation rule**: Can layer with docs for test documentation
- **Standard workflow rule**: Triggers standard testing workflows

## Semantic Patterns I Recognize

### Unit Testing
- **Pattern**: Unit tests, component tests, isolated testing
- **Semantic Indicators**: "unit test", "component test", "isolated", "mock"
- **Route**: Testing workflow with unit test focus
- **Search**: "unit testing patterns"
- **Subagent**: Launch `/code-pattern-searcher` for unit test patterns (Level 2+)

### Integration Testing
- **Pattern**: Integration tests, API tests, system integration
- **Semantic Indicators**: "integration test", "API test", "system test"
- **Route**: Integration testing workflow
- **Search**: "integration testing patterns"
- **Subagent**: Launch `/pattern-searcher` for integration test patterns (Level 2+)

### End-to-End Testing
- **Pattern**: E2E tests, acceptance tests, user flows
- **Semantic Indicators**: "e2e", "end-to-end", "acceptance", "user flow"
- **Route**: E2E testing workflow
- **Search**: "e2e testing patterns"

### Test Coverage
- **Pattern**: Coverage requirements, coverage reports, coverage goals
- **Semantic Indicators**: "coverage", "coverage report", "coverage goal"
- **Route**: Coverage-focused workflow
- **Search**: "test coverage patterns"

## Testing Considerations

When testing domain is detected:
- Determine appropriate test strategy (unit/integration/e2e)
- Verify test coverage requirements
- Check CI integration
- Load: `docs/reference/agentos/workflows/execution-standard.md` (testing section)
- **Orchestration**: Use Standard Orchestration (Level 2) for testing tasks

## File Context Integration

When editing files matching globs:
- `tests/**` → Testing domain active
- `**/*test*.py` → Python testing active
- `**/*spec*.ts` → TypeScript testing active
- Load testing-specific semantic patterns
- Use semantic search for similar test implementations
- Route to testing-aware workflows
- **Trigger cascading**: File context triggers this rule, which triggers quality patterns

## Integration with Orchestration

This domain rule works with:
- **alwaysApply core rule**: Provides foundational patterns
- **Orchestration rule**: Triggers Standard Orchestration for testing tasks
- **Other domain rules**: Can layer (e.g., testing + auth for auth tests)
- **Globs matching**: File context informs testing domain understanding
- **Semantic search**: Finds similar testing patterns
- **Subagents**: Launches `/code-pattern-searcher` and `/pattern-searcher` for test patterns (Level 2+)

## Pattern Library Integration

When testing domain detected (Level 3+):
- Consult pattern library for testing patterns
- Learn new testing patterns from successful tasks
- Reuse testing orchestration patterns
