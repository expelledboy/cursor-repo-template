# Core Values

## Purpose
Define the non-negotiable values that govern the documentation system.

## Core Values
- Minimal context, maximal alignment.
- Single source of truth per topic.
- Precedence is enforced by `governs` and `governed_by` relationships.
- Fix misalignment at the lowest layer that can resolve it.
- Keep docs actionable, lean, and explicit.

## Why Precedence Exists
- Prevent contradictions and drift.
- Enable reliable context loading.
- Make authority explicit and testable.

## What Must Not Be Overridden
- Core values in this document.
- System governance rules derived from these values.
- Domain constraints derived from governance.
