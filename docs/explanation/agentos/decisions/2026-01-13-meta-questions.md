# Decision: Meta-Questions Contract

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2026-01-13
**Scope**: agentos
**Problem IDs**: PRB-0001; PRB-0002; PRB-0003; PRB-0005

## Context
Without a stable conscience check, agents lose alignment across long tasks.

## Decision
Define a canonical set of meta-questions and a runbook for when to apply them.
See `docs/reference/agentos/meta-questions.md` and `docs/how-to/agentos/maintain-alignment.md`.

## Alternatives
- Informal self-checks with no documented questions.
- Ad-hoc questions per task.

## Consequences
- Adds a stable alignment checklist.
- Requires recording answers for traceability.

## Why this worked
Structured self-checks reduce goal drift and missing constraints.

## Artifacts
- `docs/reference/agentos/meta-questions.md`
- `docs/how-to/agentos/maintain-alignment.md`
