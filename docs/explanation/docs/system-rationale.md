# System Rationale

## Purpose
Explain why the documentation system is structured around precedence and governance.

## Why Precedence Matters
- Reduces contradictions
- Enables deterministic context loading
- Makes authority explicit

## Why Relationship-Based Governance
- Frontmatter links encode authority
- The `governs` graph is the source of precedence
- The system scales without central lists

## Maintenance Philosophy
- Fix at the lowest level that resolves misalignment
- Keep docs lean and explicit
