# Docs Domain

## Purpose / Scope
Documentation system structure, routing, and maintenance.

## Governance Constraints

- Canonical docs live in `reference`, `how-to`, or `explanation`.
- `tutorials` are learning only and lowest authority.

## Escalation / Awareness Triggers
None

## Cross-Domain Interfaces
None
