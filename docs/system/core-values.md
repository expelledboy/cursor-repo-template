# Core Values

## Purpose
Define the non-negotiable values that govern `docs/`.

## Values
- Minimal context, maximal correctness.
- Explicit authority and deterministic conflict resolution.
- Domain-first organization with clear scope boundaries.
- `intent` describes use, not authority.
- Governance is the source of precedence.
- Protect against compaction loss with explicit load checks.
