# Improvement: Self-Model Levers From Cursor Meta Review

**Status**: Draft
**Date**: 2026-01-14
**Event**: retrospective
**Task**: Cursor meta-awareness feedback review
**Evidence**: User feedback and meta review notes captured in this file
**Affected artifacts**: `docs/reference/agentos/self-model.md`, `docs/reference/agentos/self-improvement.md`, `docs/how-to/agentos/run-self-improvement-cycle.md`

## Planned
Capture candidate improvement levers surfaced by the Cursor meta review for later validation.

## Observed
The agent becomes more self-aware only after explicit prompting. The feedback suggests that self-awareness should be continuously reinforced during meta-maintenance.

## Why it happened
The current self-model is minimal and does not explicitly list awareness prompts or proactive constraints. Self-improvement remains reactive without a forcing function.

## Action items
- Consider explicit self-check prompts for lifecycle compliance.
- Consider proactive constraint checks before routing and execution.
- Consider stronger templates that are harder to skip.
- Consider systematic reflection points with defined cadence.
- Consider observable compliance signals derived from repo artifacts.

## Notes
These are candidates only. If any become required behavior, promote to a problem and ADR.
