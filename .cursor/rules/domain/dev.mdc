- Load `docs/domains/dev.md` first for dev constraints.
- Then load `docs/reference/dev/tool-stack.md` and `docs/reference/dev/justfile.md`.
- Use `docs/how-to/dev/setup.md` and `docs/how-to/dev/just-quickstart.md` for procedures.
- Use `docs/explanation/dev/tool-stack-rationale.md` only when rationale is needed.
