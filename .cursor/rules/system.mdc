description: System-level rules for precedence, docs-index, and AGENTS role
alwaysApply: true

- Use `just docs-index` first to understand the governing graph.
- Precedence is inferred from `governs` and `governed_by`. Follow the `governed_by` chain for conflicts.
- `AGENTS.md` is implementation-layer alignment and does not govern canonicals.
- Keep docs aligned to their governing docs and propagate changes downward.
