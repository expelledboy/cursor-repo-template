description: System-level rules for precedence and docs-index
alwaysApply: true

- Use `just docs-index --from <path>` to inspect the governed_by graph for a specific doc.
- Use `just docs-index` to scan the full governed_by DAG.
- Use `just docs-domains` to list domain scopes.
- Use `just docs-skills` to list available agent skills.
- Precedence is inferred from `governs` and `governed_by`. Resolve conflicts by walking `governed_by` upward.
- `AGENTS.md` is implementation-layer alignment and does not govern canonicals.
