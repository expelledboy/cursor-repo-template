description: Docs maintenance and creation
---
- When editing/creating docs, keep one canonical home per topic (reference → how-to → explanation → work → archive). Merge duplicates; add Superseded banner to older docs and move them to `docs/archive/`.
- Use lowercase kebab-case filenames (no ALL_CAPS). When adding dates to filenames or headers, use the actual current date in `YYYY-MM-DD` (no placeholders).
- Update `docs/index.md` whenever you add or change a canonical doc or move a source of truth.
- Work notes must live under `docs/work/<category>/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md` with a **Status** header. Do not leave drafts in reference/how-to/explanation.
- Include a Superseded banner for replaced docs: `Status: Superseded | Superseded by: <path> | Date: YYYY-MM-DD | Reason: …`.
