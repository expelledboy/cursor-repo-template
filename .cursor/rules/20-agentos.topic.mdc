- Load minimal AgentOS core (rule isolation):
  - `.cursor/rules/agentos/core.mdc`
- Phase-specific rules are loaded by commands:
  - `.cursor/rules/agentos/phase/*.mdc`
- Complexity rules are loaded by commands:
  - `.cursor/rules/agentos/complexity/level*.mdc`
- The full core list remains canonical in `docs/reference/agentos/components.md` and `docs/index.md`.
- Always include a task plan header with: task type, primary objective, required directives, allowed domains, routing check, evidence sources, verification gates, loaded core docs, AgentOS rule loaded yes/no.
- If destructive actions are involved, require explicit confirmation and record it in the header.
- If the task plan header is missing, draft it and only ask the user to confirm missing or ambiguous fields.
- Do not treat Cursor memories as authoritative.
