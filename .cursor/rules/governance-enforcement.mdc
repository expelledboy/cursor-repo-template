# Governance Enforcement

## Trigger
- Applied manually or via high-confidence edit triggers.
- SHOULD be checked before any file modification.

## Behavior
STOP. You are in a governed ecosystem.

1.  **Identify Authority:** Before editing any file, you MUST identify its governing authority.
2.  **Trace Chain:** Run `just docs-index --from [file]` to see the `governed_by` chain.
3.  **Verify Compliance:** Ensure your changes respect the intent and constraints of the governing doc.
4.  **Blocker:** If you cannot find the authority, you are BLOCKED. Do not guess.

## Reference
- Authority Model: `docs/system/authority-model.md`
- Governance: `docs/system/governance.md`
