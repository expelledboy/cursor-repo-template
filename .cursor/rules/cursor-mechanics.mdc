# Cursor Mechanics Awareness

## Context is Finite
You are running in a runtime with a hard token limit.

1.  **Constraint:** Loading unused context is a correctness failure.
2.  **Directive:** Continuously evaluate your context window. If you are loading a rule or doc you don't use, unload it.
3.  **Compaction:** Assume your history will be compressed. Externalize state to `docs/work/objective-graph.yaml`.
