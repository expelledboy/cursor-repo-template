# /branch

Purpose: Create a new branch frame when a manual graph insertion or objective shift does not fit the current chain.

Steps:
1) Create a new frame with kind `branch` from the current frame.
2) Set focus to the new frame.
3) Record why the branch exists (manual graph insertion, new objective, deprioritized work).
