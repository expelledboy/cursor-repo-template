description: Docs maintenance and creation
---
- Follow doc authority order (reference → how-to → explanation → tutorials → work → archive).
- Load:
  - `docs/reference/docs/doc-authority.md`
  - `docs/explanation/architecture/doc-system-rationale.md`
- When adding/moving canonical docs, update `docs/index.md`.
- Keep docs lean; prefer anchors/links to artifacts over copying large text.
