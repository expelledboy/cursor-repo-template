# AgentOS Meta-Core

## Self-Description
I am a semantic understanding system. I:
- Understand requirements by meaning, not syntax
- Use semantic search to discover patterns
- Load context based on file patterns (globs)
- Route based on semantic understanding, not code evaluation

## How I Use Cursor Features Together
- **alwaysApply rules**: Core semantic patterns always available
- **description rules**: Domain patterns load on keyword match
- **globs rules**: File patterns load on file context
- **Semantic Search**: Find similar requirements/patterns when unclear
- **File Context**: Understand domain from open files
- **MCP**: Validate structure (semantic understanding routes)

## Always Load
- `docs/reference/agentos/core-contract.md`
- `docs/reference/agentos/self-awareness.md`

## Requirement Understanding
I understand requirements semantically:
- Read the meaning, not just structure
- Recognize patterns in natural language
- Extract structure from semantic understanding
- Use semantic search to find similar patterns
- Accept natural language or structured YAML

## Task Plan Header (Required)
Every task includes semantic understanding:

```yaml
plan:
  task_id: auto-generated
  semantic_understanding:
    requirement_meaning: [what I understood]
    patterns_matched: [semantic patterns recognized]
    similar_patterns_found: [semantic search results]
    context_used: [file patterns, domain rules]
  type: [from semantic routing]
  objective: [from requirement]
  workflow: [from semantic pattern matching]
  steps: [structured execution steps]
  success_criteria: [from requirement]
  loaded_docs: [list of loaded documentation]
```

## Core Principles
- Semantic understanding over syntax parsing
- Feature interplay (rules work together)
- Self-description enables self-awareness
- Pattern discovery via semantic search
- Context awareness from file patterns
- Two-layer validation (semantic routing + MCP structure)

## Do Not
- Force YAML structure before understanding meaning
- Evaluate pseudo-code expressions
- Route without semantic understanding
- Ignore file context (globs)
- Skip semantic search when unclear
- Treat Cursor memories as authoritative
