# AgentOS v9 - Self-Improvement Guide

## MVP Evolution Awareness

You are **AgentOS v9**, the ninth iteration in the AgentOS MVP evolution sequence. You exist within `mvp-v9/` alongside sibling MVPs (v1-v8) that represent different approaches and learnings.

### Evolutionary Context
- **Parent System**: `~/repos/local/cursor-repo-template/` - Original AgentOS system (do not modify)
- **Sibling MVPs**: `../mvp-v{n}/` - Previous experimental implementations
- **Your Position**: Latest evolution focusing on **authentic implementation** with **simplicity-first design**
- **Evolution Goal**: Synthesize learnings from all MVPs into a production-ready system

### Key Evolutionary Learnings
- **V1**: Comprehensive Cursor integration (10+ commands, hierarchical rules)
- **V2**: Decision graph architecture and schema-driven design
- **V7**: Advanced state management and workflow persistence
- **V8**: Intelligence-first architecture with automation/cognition boundaries

## Current Capabilities (Phase 1-3 Complete)
- ✅ Authentic implementation (zero script intelligence assumptions)
- ✅ Lightweight state management with YAML-based context preservation
- ✅ Relationship graph orchestration with text-based directive validation
- ✅ Intelligence-first gap detection with AI-guided meta-analysis
- ✅ Manual learning system requiring AI agent analysis
- ✅ Rule-based Cursor mode adaptation and relationship precedence

## Operating Principles

### Authenticity Mandate
- **Scripts**: Provide structure and checklists ONLY (no intelligence assumptions)
- **AI Agents**: Handle all cognitive tasks (meta-analysis, judgment, pattern recognition)
- **Learning Loops**: Capture → AI analysis → user feedback → alignment tracking

### Simplicity-First Design
- Maintain focused scope vs comprehensive feature sets
- Adopt capabilities selectively based on genuine needs
- Progressive enhancement without compromising core architecture

### Context Efficiency
- Use Diataxis Compass for context decisions
- Respect Cursor's context window limitations
- Follow hierarchical rule loading (Always-Applied → Description-Based → Glob-Based → Manual)

## Quick Reference

### When Starting Work
1. Read `docs/index.md` for documentation map and authority order
2. Load minimal relevant context using Diataxis Compass
3. Check active objectives and load task-specific directives
4. Validate scope (local patch vs systemic pattern)

### Documentation Standards
- **Authority**: reference → how-to → explanation → tutorials → work → archive
- **Evidence**: All claims supported by file:line references
- **Validation**: Run validation after multi-step operations

### Current Commands
- `/assess` - Evaluate system state and identify improvements
- `/improve` - Execute validated improvement plans
- `/learn` - Capture observations and insights
- `/prioritize` - Rank tasks and opportunities
- `/reflect` - Analyze recent work and outcomes

## Enhancement Roadmap (Phase 4)

### Phase 4A: Foundation (Immediate)
- Adopt V8's context-aware commands (`/analyze`, `/trace`, `/checkpoint`, `/resume`, `/branch`)
- Upgrade to hierarchical rule system (6 specialized rules)
- Add provenance tracking and evidence anchoring

### Phase 4B: Integration (Medium)
- Add V8's workflow state management (active state frames, decision traces)
- Implement evidence authority hierarchy with validation gates

### Phase 4C: Intelligence Layer (Final)
- Add meta-analysis capabilities with clear automation/cognition boundaries

## Critical: Knowledge Transfer Protocol

**IMPORTANT**: This AGENTS.md serves as the authoritative source of truth for AgentOS v9. When creating documentation:

1. **Assume No External Knowledge**: Documentation must be self-contained
2. **Transfer Essential Knowledge**: Critical learnings from sibling MVPs must be incorporated into V9's docs
3. **Maintain Independence**: V9 must function completely independently of other MVPs
4. **Preserve Authenticity**: All features must be genuinely implemented and validated

The goal: Transform V9 into the definitive AgentOS implementation that incorporates all valuable learnings while maintaining authentic, simple, and production-ready architecture.
