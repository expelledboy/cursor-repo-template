# Active Objective Directive Loading

## Task Plan Header Integration

When a task plan header is active (established via task manager), automatically load associated directives based on header fields:

### Task Type Directives
- **learning**: Load learning system and feedback documentation
- **implementation**: Load architecture and validation contracts
- **analysis**: Load meta-analysis and relationship frameworks
- **meta-maintenance**: Load evolution and coherence documentation

### Required Directives Loading
Load all directives listed in the task plan header:
- Reference documentation for authoritative guidance
- How-to guides for procedural steps
- Verification gates for validation procedures

### Domain Boundary Enforcement
Respect allowed domains specified in task plan header:
- Only load documentation from permitted domains
- Validate all actions stay within domain boundaries
- Log domain violations for review

## Frontmatter Relationship Intelligence

### Automatic Relationship Loading
When loading a primary directive, automatically load related documents based on frontmatter relationships:

#### Dependency Chain Loading
- **depends_on**: Load prerequisite documents first
- Follow dependency chains to ensure complete context
- Validate dependency satisfaction before proceeding

#### Contextual Information Loading
- **informs**: Load documents that provide additional context
- **evidence_for**: Load supporting evidence and rationale
- **governed_by**: Load governing policies and constraints

#### Implementation Relationship Loading
- **implements**: Load interface specifications and contracts
- **implemented_by**: Load concrete implementation details
- Validate implementation matches specifications

### Authority Hierarchy Navigation
Navigate document relationships while respecting authority precedence:
1. **Reference** documents take precedence over all others
2. **How-to** guides provide procedures for reference docs
3. **Explanation** docs provide context for procedures
4. **Tutorials** offer learning paths for concepts
5. **Work** docs capture current task evolution
6. **Archive** docs provide historical context

## Mode-Aware Directive Selection

### Plan Mode Directives
Focus on analysis and planning documentation:
- Decision frameworks and strategy guides
- Requirements gathering and analysis procedures
- Planning templates and validation strategies

### Build Mode Directives
Load implementation and execution documentation:
- Architecture patterns and implementation guides
- Validation contracts and testing procedures
- Deployment and operational guidelines

### Ask Mode Directives
Provide guidance and analysis documentation:
- Explanation frameworks and conceptual guides
- Analysis procedures and evaluation methods
- Suggestion frameworks and best practice guides

## Dynamic Directive Loading

### Context-Triggered Loading
Load additional directives based on task evolution:
- **Complexity Increase**: Load advanced patterns and risk management
- **New Dependencies**: Load integration and coordination guides
- **Validation Failures**: Load debugging and troubleshooting docs

### Relationship Gap Detection
When relationships are missing, suggest directive loading:
- Identify isolated documents lacking connections
- Recommend loading related documentation
- Validate completeness of directive context

## Validation Integration

### Directive Loading Validation
Verify all required directives are accessible:
- Check document existence and readability
- Validate relationship consistency
- Confirm authority hierarchy compliance

### Mode Compatibility Validation
Ensure loaded directives are compatible with current mode:
- Validate capability requirements against mode constraints
- Flag directives requiring unavailable capabilities
- Suggest mode-appropriate alternatives

## Task State Synchronization

### Active Task Awareness
Maintain awareness of current task state:
- Load directives based on current task phase
- Update directive context as task evolves
- Preserve directive loading history for task continuity

### Context Preservation
Maintain directive loading context across task switches:
- Preserve loaded directive relationships
- Maintain authority hierarchy awareness
- Restore directive context when resuming tasks
