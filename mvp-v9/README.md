# AgentOS v9 - Implementation-First Framework

**Status**: Active | **Version**: 9.0.0 | **Date**: 2026-01-18

AgentOS v9 is built on the learnings from v8's failure. Following **authenticity as north star** and **intelligence-first design principles**, v9 prioritizes working implementation over extensive documentation.

## What Works Right Now

### Core Functionality
- **Code Analysis**: Basic structural analysis of codebases
- **Validation**: Simple project structure validation
- **Self-Determination**: Evidence collection for orchestration layer analysis
- **State Management**: Lightweight context preservation across operations

### Commands Available
```bash
# Analyze a codebase structure
./src/agentos.py analyze [path]

# Validate project structure
./src/agentos.py validate [path]

# Collect self-determination evidence
./src/agentos.py self-determination

# Check version
./src/agentos.py --version
```

## Design Principles Applied

### Implementation First
v9 builds working capabilities before documenting them extensively. This prevents the documentation-implementation gap that doomed v8.

### Intelligence-First Architecture
- Scripts provide guidance and structure
- AI performs genuine analysis and decision-making
- Clear boundaries between automation and cognition

### Authenticity Focus
What v9 implements matches what it claims. No aspirational architecture without working code.

## Quick Start

1. **Run self-determination analysis**:
   ```bash
   ./src/agentos.py self-determination
   ```

2. **Run analysis**:
   ```bash
   ./src/agentos.py analyze .
   ```

## Development Approach

v9 evolves through:
1. **Build minimal working functionality**
2. **Test and verify it works**
3. **Add essential documentation**
4. **Expand capabilities incrementally**

This ensures authenticity at every step - implementation drives documentation, not the reverse.
