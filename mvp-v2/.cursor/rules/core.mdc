# AgentOS Core

## Always Load
- `docs/reference/agentos/core-contract.md`

## Requirement Structure
All tasks must start with a structured requirement. Use this template:

```yaml
task:
  type: execution | coordination | architecture | meta
  objective: Clear single sentence (10-200 chars)
  scope:
    files: [optional list]
    domains: [required list]
  constraints:
    time: optional
    dependencies: [optional]
    risks: [optional]
  success_criteria:
    - measurable outcome 1
    - measurable outcome 2
  context:
    background: optional
    related_tasks: [optional]
```

## Task Plan Header (Required)
Every task must include:

```yaml
plan:
  task_id: auto-generated
  type: [from requirement]
  objective: [from requirement]
  workflow: [from decision graph]
  steps: [structured execution steps]
  success_criteria: [from requirement]
  loaded_docs: [list of loaded documentation]
```

## Core Principles
- Structured requirements (YAML schema)
- Documentation-driven behavior
- Deterministic routing via decision graphs
- Validation at boundaries (intake, execution, outcome)
- Single source of truth

## Do Not
- Accept unstructured requirement blobs
- Skip requirement structure validation
- Proceed without task plan header
- Treat Cursor memories as authoritative
