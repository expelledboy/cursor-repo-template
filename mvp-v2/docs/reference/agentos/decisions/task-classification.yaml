# Task Classification Decision Graph

description: Routes tasks to appropriate workflow type based on requirement structure

steps:
  - id: check_objective_clarity
    question: Is the objective clear and unambiguous?
    condition: "task.objective.length >= 10 and task.objective.length <= 200"

    confidence: 0.95
    terminal: false
    fallback: check_stakeholders

  - id: check_stakeholders
    question: Are multiple stakeholders involved or coordination required?
    condition: "task.scope.domains.length > 1 or 'coordination' in task.objective.lower()"
    route: coordination
    load: docs/reference/agentos/workflows/coordination.md

    fallback: check_complexity

  - id: check_complexity
    question: Does this involve architectural decisions or system-wide changes?
    condition: "'architecture' in task.type or 'system' in task.objective.lower() or 'refactor' in task.objective.lower()"
    route: architecture

  - id: direct_execution
    question: Simple, isolated change?
    condition: "task.scope.domains.length == 1 and task.constraints.risks.length == 0"
    route: direct
