# AgentOS Security Task Instructions

## Load Security Directives
- `mvp/docs/reference/agentos/coherence-contract.md` (safety policy section)
- `mvp/docs/reference/agentos/decision-graphs/validation-strategy.md`

## Security Protocol
1. **Secrets Detection**: Block and alert if secrets detected in code
2. **Confirmation Required**: Explicit confirmation for security boundary changes
3. **Threat Modeling**: Consider security implications before implementation
4. **Validation**: Security audit required for Level 3+ tasks

## Safety Constraints
- Do not log secrets or credentials
- Do not commit secrets to version control
- Require explicit user confirmation for security-related changes
- Validate against safety policy constraints

## Validation Gates
- Security audit (OAuth flow, token handling, session management)
- Secrets scanning
- Authentication flow validation
- Security best practices compliance
