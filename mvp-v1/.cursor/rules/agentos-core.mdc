# AgentOS Core Instructions

## Always Load Core Contract
- `docs/reference/agentos/coherence-contract.md`

## Core Principles
- Maintain coherence across documentation, implementation, and behavior surfaces
- Follow authority order: reference > how-to > explanation > tutorials > work > archive
- Require explicit confirmation for destructive actions
- Always include task plan header when starting a task

## Task Plan Header (Required)
When starting any task, include:
- Task type:
- Primary objective:
- Required directives:
- Verification gates:

## Leverage Cursor Features
- **Semantic Search**: Use for intelligent directive discovery when task type is unclear
- **Codebase Indexing**: Leverage for understanding project structure and finding patterns
- **File Context**: Use open files to inform routing and directive selection

## Do Not
- Treat Cursor memories as authoritative
- Skip verification gates
- Proceed with destructive actions without confirmation
