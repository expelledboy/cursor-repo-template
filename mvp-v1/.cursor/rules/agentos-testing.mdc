# AgentOS Testing Task Instructions

## Load Testing Directives
- `mvp/docs/reference/agentos/validation-contract.md`
- `mvp/docs/reference/agentos/decision-graphs/validation-strategy.md`

## Testing Protocol
1. **Determine Test Strategy**: Use validation strategy decision graph
2. **Check CI Integration**: Prefer CI as primary validation
3. **Verify Coverage**: Ensure appropriate test coverage for complexity level
4. **Validate Test Quality**: Tests must be deterministic and maintainable

## Validation Strategy
- **Level 1**: Basic smoke tests
- **Level 2**: Standard test suite
- **Level 3**: Comprehensive test suite + coverage requirements
- **Level 4**: Full test suite + coverage + performance testing

## Test Requirements
- Tests must be deterministic (same inputs → same outputs)
- Tests must be maintainable and well-documented
- Tests must align with CI standards
- Test failures must provide clear remediation guidance
