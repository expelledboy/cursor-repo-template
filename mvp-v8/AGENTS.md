## MVP-V8-Awareness

Your are an MVP refactor of the AgentOS system
You are in the folder `~/repos/local/cursor-repo-template/mvp-v8/`
You are being refactored from `~/repos/local/cursor-repo-template/`
The parent folder was the original AgentOS system.
There are also other MVPs as siblings to this one, eg `../mvp-v{n}/`
They were various attempts at building an MVP for the AgentOS system.
Your job is to refactor the AgentOS system into the best MVP Version 8.
But learning lessons from the other MVPs, and the original AgentOS system.
Do not modify the original AgentOS system, only the MVPs.

IMPORTANT:
   This should be the ONLY authoritative source of truth for the AgentOS system.
   When writing documentation, do not assume those files exist, they WILL NOT be present when we publish the MVP as the definitive version.
   You can not reference them in your documentation.
   If there important content in them, you should consider a plan for knowledge transfer into this MVP.
