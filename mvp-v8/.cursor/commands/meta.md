# `/meta` - Meta-Analysis Mode Activation

**Purpose**: Activate Meta-Analysis Mode (MAM) - a cognitive framework where scripts provide structured guidance for AI-performed meta-analysis. Intelligence cannot be scripted - it must be performed by the AI agent within reasoning phases.

**When to Use**:
- When you suspect alignment issues with AgentOS behavior
- After failed validation or unexpected system behavior
- Before critical decisions that affect core system behavior
- When continuous self-awareness indicates persistent problems
- When you want to validate AgentOS alignment with DOE principles

**Architectural Note**: MAM is a cognitive framework, not an automated script. Scripts provide guidance and checklists, but the actual analysis and judgment must be performed by the AI agent through cognitive reasoning.

## Command Contract

### Cognitive Framework Design
**MAM is intelligence-guided, not automated.** The system provides structured guidance through checklists and frameworks, but the actual meta-analysis must be performed by the AI agent through cognitive reasoning.

### Activation Process
1. **User calls**: `/meta`
2. **System provides guidance framework**: Presents MAM checklist and cognitive analysis structure
3. **AI performs cognitive analysis**: Applies intelligence to each checkpoint within reasoning phases
4. **System structures findings**: Formats AI analysis results with actionable recommendations

### Cognitive Boundaries
MAM operates within AI cognitive constraints:
- **Reasoning phase analysis**: Meta-analysis occurs within LLM reasoning, not scripts
- **Guidance framework**: Scripts provide structure and checklists only
- **Intelligence application**: AI agent applies judgment and analysis to each checkpoint
- **Deterministic process**: Framework ensures systematic application while enabling cognitive depth

## MAM Cognitive Analysis Framework

MAM provides structured guidance for AI cognitive analysis. The AI agent must apply intelligence and judgment to each checkpoint:

### 1. Task Plan Header Completeness (Cognitive Analysis Required)
**Guidance:** Evaluate whether the current task plan demonstrates proper planning intelligence
- [ ] Does the task type align with observed complexity and requirements?
- [ ] Is the objective clearly measurable and achievable?
- [ ] Has appropriate complexity assessment been applied?
- [ ] Are workflow variations suitable for the context?
- [ ] Have relevant directives been identified through analysis?
- [ ] Are evidence sources authoritative and appropriate?
- [ ] Have verification gates been properly scoped?

### 2. Directive Loading Compliance (Cognitive Analysis Required)
**Guidance:** Analyze whether directive loading demonstrates proper architectural awareness
- [ ] Have required directives been loaded based on cognitive assessment?
- [ ] Are Context Compass constraints properly understood and applied?
- [ ] Is directive loading sequence appropriate for the task?
- [ ] Are documentation types selected based on genuine need analysis?

### 3. Evidence Source Validation (Cognitive Analysis Required)
**Guidance:** Evaluate evidence quality through intelligent assessment
- [ ] Do sources follow proper authority hierarchy based on context?
- [ ] Are sources current and appropriate for the analysis?
- [ ] Do sources genuinely support the stated objectives?
- [ ] Is source accessibility verified through cognitive checking?

### 4. Verification Gate Completeness (Cognitive Analysis Required)
**Guidance:** Assess whether verification strategy demonstrates planning intelligence
- [ ] Are verification gates appropriate for the actual task complexity?
- [ ] Do gate commands represent genuine validation needs?
- [ ] Is the gate sequence logical based on task lifecycle analysis?
- [ ] Has failure handling been thoughtfully designed?

### 5. Safety Compliance (Cognitive Analysis Required)
**Guidance:** Evaluate safety measures through intelligent risk assessment
- [ ] Have destructive actions been identified through proper analysis?
- [ ] Are rollback plans appropriate for the actual risks involved?
- [ ] Do safety policies align with genuine task requirements?
- [ ] Is input handling designed with appropriate security analysis?

### 6. Gap Capture Status (Cognitive Analysis Required)
**Guidance:** Assess whether gap identification demonstrates learning intelligence
- [ ] Have gaps been identified through genuine analysis rather than assumption?
- [ ] Are improvement events triggered based on actual need assessment?
- [ ] Is gap promotion to registry based on systemic impact analysis?

### 7. Contract Compliance (Cognitive Analysis Required)
**Guidance:** Verify DOE adherence through architectural understanding
- [ ] Are DOE phases followed based on genuine process understanding?
- [ ] Is authority order applied through contextual judgment?
- [ ] Is context usage appropriate for the actual task scope?
- [ ] Are self-awareness checkpoints applied with cognitive awareness?

### 8. Architectural Validation (Cognitive Analysis Required)
**Guidance:** Assess system design through architectural intelligence
- [ ] Does interface design match actual usage environment constraints?
- [ ] Is context loading efficient based on genuine usage analysis?
- [ ] Are naming conventions semantically appropriate for functions?
- [ ] Do interaction patterns align with cognitive workflow needs?

### 9. User Experience Validation (Cognitive Analysis Required)
**Guidance:** Evaluate UX through genuine user interaction understanding
- [ ] Are commands discoverable based on actual user needs analysis?
- [ ] Is error messaging helpful from a cognitive perspective?
- [ ] Do interactions feel natural based on conversational analysis?
- [ ] Is complexity disclosure appropriate for user cognitive load?

```

### Issues Found
```
⚠️ MAM Complete - Alignment issues detected
❌ Issues requiring attention:
   • Task plan missing complexity assessment
   • Evidence sources include inappropriate archived docs
   • Verification gates not defined for task type

💡 Recommended actions:
   • Complete task plan header with missing elements
   • Replace archived sources with current references
   • Add verification gates for Implementation / Feature tasks
   • Consider `/learn` to capture planning improvement gap
```

### Gap Discovery
When MAM identifies gaps:
1. **Immediate work note creation** with gap details
2. **Improvement event proposal** (micro-AAR, retrospective, postmortem)
3. **Traceability linking** to MAM findings
4. **Registry integration** if core behavior affected

## Integration with Other Commands

### `/retrospect` Integration
- `/retrospect` can trigger MAM for deeper analysis
- MAM validates `/retrospect` findings against broader context
- MAM provides systematic framework for `/retrospect` issues

### `/learn` Integration
- MAM findings automatically suggest `/learn` captures
- MAM validates learning system effectiveness
- MAM identifies gaps in learning capture processes

### `/evolve` Integration
- MAM results inform `/evolve` improvement priorities
- MAM validates evolution system alignment
- MAM ensures evolution changes don't break core contracts

## Success Criteria

### Effective MAM Activation
- **Issue identification**: Finds real alignment issues without false positives
