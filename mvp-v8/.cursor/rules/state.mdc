description: "State management for complex workflows - provides context for checkpoint, trace, and resume operations during restructuring"
file_patterns: ["docs/**/*.md"]
---
- Load active state from `docs/local/active-state.yaml`
- Use frames for resumable context
- Prefer simple anchors over complex references

When managing complex restructuring workflows, include state management context and decision tracing capabilities.

Use `/checkpoint` to save progress, `/trace` to understand current reasoning state, and `/resume` to continue interrupted workflows. Decision traces provide transparency without requiring full audit trails.
