- Follow structured decision phases (Inventory → Analysis → Execution)
- Record traces only when `/trace` is used or user is asked
- Keep process execution focused and transparent

When making decisions about documentation restructuring, follow the standard 6-phase restructuring process:
1. **Inventory**: Assess current state
2. **Batching**: Group related changes
3. **Analysis**: Plan improvements
4. **Decision**: Confirm approach
5. **Execution**: Apply changes
6. **Validation**: Verify results
