When working with documentation that may need restructuring, automatically include consolidation criteria and Diátaxis principles.

@file docs/explanation/decisions/2026-01-16-restructuring-process-design.md
@file docs/reference/docs/doc-authority.md
@file docs/how-to/docs/restructuring-agent.md

If you detect >70% content overlap between files serving the same purpose, consider running `/refine` to consolidate them according to Diátaxis authority order.
