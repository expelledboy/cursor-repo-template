# External links are lost during distillation

## Observation
External links are lost during distillation.

## Impact
Loss of references and external context makes the distilled documentation less useful and requires re-finding sources.

## Evidence
Observed during manual testing of the /distill command.

## Potential Solutions
Update the /distill command to explicitly preserve external URLs.
