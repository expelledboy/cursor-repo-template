# Cursor Integration Depth

## Description
How to fully leverage Cursor's semantic search, MCP tools, rules, and mentions for enhanced reasoning capabilities.

## Impact
Underutilizing Cursor features limits the system's ability to incorporate rich context and evidence.

## Evidence
Cursor provides multiple integration points (search, tools, rules, mentions) that can significantly enhance decision quality.
