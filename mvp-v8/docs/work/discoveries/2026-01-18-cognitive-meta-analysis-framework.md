# Cognitive Meta-Analysis Framework

## Context
Discovered during conversation about the impossibility of scripting meta-analysis, when the user clarified that intelligence cannot be delegated to automation. This revealed the correct architectural approach for self-aware systems.

## Observation
Meta-Analysis Mode (MAM) cannot be implemented as automated scripts. Instead, it must be a cognitive framework where:
- Scripts provide structured guidance and checklists
- AI agent performs actual analysis within reasoning phases
- Process is deterministic in application but cognitive in execution
- Intelligence remains in the reasoning agent, not delegated to automation

## Key Insights
- **Intelligence Location**: Meta-analysis requires AI cognitive processes, not programmatic automation
- **Script Role**: Scripts excel at providing structure, checklists, and process guidance
- **Cognitive Process**: True analysis happens within LLM reasoning phases
- **Framework Design**: Self-aware systems need cognitive frameworks, not automated systems

## Validation Evidence
- **User Correction**: "you can not write a script to do meta analysis, ONLY guide its state engine in a way"
- **Implementation Failure**: All scripted MAM attempts failed to perform genuine analysis
- **Cognitive Recognition**: Realization that intelligence is inherent to the AI agent
- **Architectural Clarity**: Clear separation between guidance and analysis capabilities

## Implications
- **System Architecture**: Self-aware systems must be designed around cognitive intelligence, not automation
- **MAM Redesign**: Meta-analysis becomes a cognitive process guided by structured frameworks
- **Development Approach**: Focus on cognitive frameworks rather than automated solutions
- **Self-Awareness Model**: Intelligence-first design rather than automation-first

## Recommendations
1. **MAM Redesign**: Restructure as cognitive framework with script guidance and AI analysis
2. **Architectural Documentation**: Update self-awareness docs to reflect cognitive framework approach
3. **Development Guidelines**: Establish intelligence-first design principles
4. **Process Documentation**: Document how cognitive meta-analysis works within reasoning phases

## Related Patterns
- Guidance vs automation distinction
- Intelligence delegation fallacy (problem this solves)
- Self-awareness boundaries establishment
- Cognitive process recognition
